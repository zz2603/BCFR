# Breast Epi

* primary key is personal id (unique), so every tables we created need to carry personal id.

```{r}
# import the breast_epi
## bc_epi <- read_csv("...") %>% janitor::clean_names()

# filter out subjects in US and Canndian registries
## bc_epi <- filter(bc_epi, center_no %in% c(1,2,3,5,6))

# select variables about age
## bc_epi_age <- select(bc_epi,person_id,dt_interview,age_interview)

# select varaibles about education
## bc_epi_edu <- select(bc_epi,person_id,education)

# select variables about marital status
## bc_epi_marstat <- select(bc_epi,person_id,marstat)

# select variables about race
## bc_epi_racevar <- colnames(bc_epi) %>% str_detect("race")
## bc_epi_



```

Problem about data:
* why are there four variables about race? (their questions are exactly same, so why repeated?)
* Why is there a variable about race in text?
